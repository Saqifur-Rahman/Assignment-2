## lastIndexOf()

- Without using the native “Array.prototype.lastIndexOf” method of JavaScript, compose a function titled “myLastIndexOf” that will take in an 
array of elements and returns the index of the last encounter of a target element (if it is found) or -1 if that element does not exist within 
the input array.
